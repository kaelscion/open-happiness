# open-happiness
Bring happiness to folks on a daily basis

An attempt to bring a little positivity to people on a daily basis. Open Happiness is intended as a service that will generate 
an image search query for something positive by randomly drawing keywords from several database tables (think madlibs), then 
submitting this query to sites such as Google Images and Youtube and downloading the results for display on a continuous-scroll 
web page. All content will be acquired and presented with the intent of brightening and/or turning around a bad day through 
positive or humorous imagery!
